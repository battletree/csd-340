                    <div class="card-content">
                        This is a pretty straight forward job - during college I was a bartender and all that it entailed, basically I made drinks and kept the place clean.  Although there were a number of interesting stories every time I came home from work, the job was very fun and certainly one of the favorites I have had.  This is probably because of the low stakes environment but none the less it was the perfect job while in school.

                        Guest Experience Coordinator
                    </div>
                    <div class="card-content">
                        This is one of the the two jobs that I currently work.  As a Guest Experience Coordinator I do my best to ensure that guests are having a good time and have the resources they need in order to enjoy themselves.  This job is quite busy as it mainly entails keeping track of the Guest Experience Team members and ensuring that they are going where they are needed in a timely manner.

                    <div class="card-content">
                      Similar to the Guest Experience Team Coordinator job - a Guest Relations Coordinator works in a similar capacity in order to ensure that their guests are taken care of.  This role differs from the other in and of that this role is mainly in a recovery capacity.  This means that by the time the guest has come to see you they are generally already unhappy and have not been able to find a solution with the individual they had previously been working with.
